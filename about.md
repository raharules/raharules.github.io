Persian-American soprano Raha Mirzadegan is a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist based in New York and DC. A lover of sacred music and collaboration—her repertoire spans the medieval chant of Hildegard von Bingen to premiering new works by living composers.

Raha is the founder and director of The Uηdercroft, a DC-based vocal ensemble dedicated to unearthing and restoring unpublished works and premiering them for modern audiences. The group specializes in one-on-a-part renaissance polyphony.

An advocate for new music, Raha was selected by composer Eric Pazdziora to direct and perform the world premiere of "Nativity of the Isles" as the soloist. Raha and Eric are currently organizing several additional projects. She has worked with composer Elliot Cole, and premiered the compositions of Owen Burdick, William Kenlon, Scott AuCoin, and Jacob Coppage-Gross. In addition to these partnerships—Raha, herself, is a songwriter, arranger, poet, and composer.
