Persian-American soprano, Raha Mirzadegan, is a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist based in Brooklyn, New York. Her repertoire spans from singing the medieval chant of Hildegard von Bingen to premiering new works by living composers. Last fall, she was a member of the Maryland Opera Studio at the University of Maryland, where she also received a Bachelor of Music. During her time at the university, she studied with Gran Wilson, and was a chorister and soloist with the award-winning Chamber Singers, under the direction of Dr. Edward Maclary. Additionally, she sang in Master Classes with Dawn Upshaw and Matthew Halls.
