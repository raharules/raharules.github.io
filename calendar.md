<b>DRIFT: An Opera in Three Acts</b><br>
New Opera Workshop @ Opera America<br>

DRIFT is a story of motherhood, migration and climate change, exploring the forces that drive families from their homes into the uncertain refuge of new lands. Braiding an intimate narrative between Esmeralda and her childhood friend, James, DRIFT opens in a glacial landscape scarred by ecological disaster. Swinging between the domestic and the surreal, the second act returns to the terminal green of the characters’ youths as they navigate in a toxic-laden panorama of swamplands and power plants. An intersectional portrait of identity, DRIFT necessitates a radically new examination of motherlands, geography and memory. 

Original story and libretto by J. Mae Barizo, and music by Alyssa Weinberg. Currently under development, supported by Opera America’s Discovery Grant program and made possible by the Virginia B. Toulmin Foundation. DRIFT is actively looking for additional support and welcomes interest from co-commissioners and presenters.

<b>Gawain and the Green Knight</b><br>
A Medieval New Year's Legend<br>
by Doug Balliett<br>
Raha reprises the role of Guinevere<br>
New York City

Performed by Elisse Albian, Jesse Blumberg, Taylor Ward, Jonathan Woody, Karim Sulayman, Elisa Sutherland, Raha Mirzadegan, members of ACRONYM, Ruckus, AMOC, and more.

Gawain and the Green Knight: a Christmas story, a horror story, a romance, a paean to nature. All set at King Arthur’s court which huddles in its luxury on the borders of unforgiving wilderness and forces unknown. Gawain has agreed to have his head chopped off in a year’s time. But why? And can he live up to his promise, or his legendary perfection?

<b>OCKEGHEM MARATHON AT THE MET CLOISTERS</b><br>

Over a period of five hours, the different instrumental and vocal consorts from The Clarion Choir and The Clarion Orchestra will explore the works of Johannes Ockeghem in various parts of the Cloisters, including the Romanesque Hall, Cuxa Cloister, Langon Chapel, and Saint Guilhem Cloister. Ockeghem was one of the most influential early Renaissance composers and an important proponent of the Franco-Flemish School. After looking at his earlier and middle period works with smaller ensembles throughout the day, the Clarion singers and players will come together for a final concert of his later works from 7-8pm in the glorious Fuentidueña Chapel.
